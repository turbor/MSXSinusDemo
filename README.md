# MSXSinusDemo
Sinewave demo on MSX1

This code shows a fullscreen sinewave on an MSX1 machine.
And given the fact that it is a wave there is a small ship on top of the wave :-)

If you are not intrested in the source code you can simply download the single rom file 
https://github.com/turbor/MSXSinusDemo/raw/master/msxsindm.rom  and run it on your msx computer.


The demo is developed on a linux machine using pasmo as compiler and running on the openMSX emulator. Both pasmo and openMSX are available directly from most linux distributions software repositories.
